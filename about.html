The principles are applied to all personal data processing and say what is an allowed process. There are more principles but some of them are that you have to have support from the data protection regulation to be able to keep the personal information, and to not treat more personal information than necessary. You should also delete the personal information when it is no longer needed. Companies that do not follow this regulation will have to pay up to millions in fines.</p><p>There are many benefits of GDPR mainly for individuals as it increases transparency between them and the company. Thus, private individuals have more control over their personal data than before, another advantage of the GDPR is that it applies throughout the EU, then the processing becomes the same and you can, for example, refuse to certain processing of personal data. For example when it comes to sensitive information such as sexual orientation, ethnicity, political affiliation, etc. In order to process it's sensitive information, special conditions are required. To summarize, GDPR is for those that are primarily private individuals as it benefits them the most.</p><p>The disadvantages of GDPR or rather those that are mainly against the GDPR are the companies. As they are forced to introduce GDPR and its routines which leads to more jobs as well as to teach the staff GDPR which takes time and effort. Some companies also believe that they lose a certain income with GDPR, as it is no longer allowed to sell their customer registers to other companies in the same way as before. Even now, companies must have stricter protection against this personal data that they collect so that no unauthorized persons receive access to the information. To Summarize, companies are mainly against the GDPR as it does not benefit them.</p><p>Copyright: This is a law that protects petitions av speech and writing like for example databases. This law give the creator of something such as an image exclusive right to choose how it wil be used, spread and processed. For something to recognised by this law it should reach the working height, as in that it should have originality or individual distinctiveness as a result of its creation. The exclusive right applies from when the work was created until the entirety of the creators life.</p><p>Electronic Communication: This is a law that was made official in 2003.
